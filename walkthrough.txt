This game is based on the animated Disney Pixar movie "WALL-E" so if you're not familiar with the plot of the movie
please consider looking up the wikipedia-page https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WALL-E (spoiler alert!)

!! Some parts of the game is NOT compatible with the AdventureGUI, which is why it's not included in this version!!

The intended way to play the game:

In the welcome message it appears a package got lowered to the ground in location "airport".
The player start at home. From there places available are: airport
-> go airport
You see items at location airport, pick them up.
-> get phone
-> get trash
If you open your inventory you notice there's only the phone there (WALL-E getss rid of the trash)
-> inventory
You see nonplayer in area. Interact with them.
-> Interact eve
- You get her mission and feature (scanning items) and WALL-E's reaction to it.
She seems to seek for signs of life. But you don't get to know more. Continue journey.
-> go field
-> get trash
-> go museum
-> get trash
When you pick up the trash in the museum there suddenly is a threath(sandstrom) and you must hide.
-> hide (everything else gets you killed)
Now a plant has appeared in the location. EVE said something about signs of life. Maybe you should show it to her.
-> get plant
-> go field
-> go airport
-> show plant to eve
When she scans it and gets a match. She contacts the spaceship Axiom and a few moments later
the spaceship lands in the airport area and a human approaches them.
-> interact human
The human asks EVE for her find, who then says WALL-E has the plant.
The human then asks WALL-E if he has the plant on him, which makes WAll-E (good-natured that he is) show it to the human.
-> show plant to human
Gets reaction from human, who then asks if WALL-E can give the plant to the human. (activates final dilemma)
-> yes -> wins game (FIN)
-> no -> the human gets mad. You have to either fight or flee.
    -> fight -> if you have nokia phone on you -> human dies (GAME OVER), else: you get deactivated (GAME OVER)
    -> run -> you run away (the game continues)
If battery is running low. A full battery lasts 14 turns.
-> go home
-> charge

Possible endings:
- run out of battery
- die in sandstorm
- fight human but with no weapon(you need to have the nokia phone on you)
- killing the human with the nokia phone
- show plant to human -> yes (wins game)

(Some easter eggs in the game is showing different items to EVE and the human and get their reactions/descriptions of said items)
